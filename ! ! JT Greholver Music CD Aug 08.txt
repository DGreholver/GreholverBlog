August, 2008

There are several songs and a complete musical on this CD.
They have been written and polished over the years and are not copywrited, except for "A Simple Prayer", which has a copywrited version edited by Terry Camsey and published by The Salvation Army.

The following songs are included:
-- A Simple Prayer
-- Child Song
-- His Friend
-- I Will Wait
-- The King in Me
-- Gentle Spirit

A musical, Journey to Jericho, is also included with several songs plust the script.

The key documents included are published in MS Word, and contain convenient hyperlinks to the scores and MP3 sound files.

The documents have an exclamation point [ ! ] before the name, which forces them to the top of an alphabetized list of files, for convenience.

The JTJ Script also includes a convenient hyperlinked table at the end so that the different files needed can be more easily retrieved.

The scores are published in the common Acrobat PDF format, and the music in the common MP3 format for playback on most players.

You can get a free PDF reader and a free MS Word reader on the internet for viewing the files for the greatest convenience.
